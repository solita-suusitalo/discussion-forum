# Frontend Designer

## When to Use

- Creating a new SvelteKit route/page from scratch
- Building a new reusable Svelte component
- Styling or re-theming UI sections
- Adding forms with validation and loading states
- Extending the design system (new tokens, new utility classes)
- Making the UI consistent with the existing design language

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

The user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

Then implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:

- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.

Remember: Copilot is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.


## 9. Workflow: Building a New Feature

1. **Identify scope** — new route, enhancement to existing page, or reusable component?
2. **Read related files** — check the closest existing page for patterns to follow
3. **Design tokens first** — confirm all colors/spacing you need exist in `_variables.scss`; add missing ones
4. **Create files** — page files under `src/routes/`, components under `src/lib/components/`
5. **Wire up data** — public reads → `+page.ts` load; auth-gated reads → `onMount`; mutations → event handlers
6. **Use global utility classes** — `.container`, `.btn--*`, `.form-group`, `.alert--*` before writing custom CSS
7. **Write scoped styles** — BEM naming, SCSS nesting, CSS variables only
8. **Auth-conditional UI** — wrap owner/user-only UI in `{#if auth.current}` or `{#if isOwner}`
9. **Error and loading states** — every async action needs `loading` state and an error display

## 10. Quality Checklist

Before considering a page/component done:

- [ ] All colors/spacing use CSS variables — no hardcoded values
- [ ] Global utility classes used where applicable (`.btn`, `.form-group`, etc.)
- [ ] Loading state on every async action; button `disabled` during load
- [ ] Error state displayed with `.alert.alert--error` when async fails
- [ ] Auth-gated actions wrapped in `{#if auth.current}`
- [ ] `<svelte:head>` includes a `<title>` tag
- [ ] Component scoped styles use BEM-ish naming and SCSS nesting
- [ ] No hardcoded API URLs — always use `createApi` from `$lib/api`
- [ ] No Prisma or database code in SvelteKit files
